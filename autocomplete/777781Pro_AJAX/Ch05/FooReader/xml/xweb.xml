My prayers are with those in London.]]></description><dc:date>2005-07-07T09:50:24.170</dc:date></item><item><title>Usability</title><link>http://www.wdonline.com/?postid=140</link><description><![CDATA[I'm big on usability.  If something doesn't work how you would expect it to, then there is something wrong.  For some reason, I always felt the need to doubleclick an item in <a href="http://reader.wdonline.com" title="FooReader.NET">FooReader.NET</a> to go to the actual blog post.  Yeah... sure... a link was provided in the reading pane, but it felt awkward (for the lack of a better term) to move your mouse just to go to the site.<br /><br />I updated it a bit so that if you double click an item in the item pane, it opens a new window and takes you to the blog post.  It just feels right.]]></description><dc:date>2005-07-04T17:56:36.873</dc:date></item><item><title>[Golem]They Took It From Us&apos;s[/Golem]</title><link>http://www.wdonline.com/?postid=139</link><description><![CDATA[Am I surprised?  No, but I still can't believe it happened <b>the same day</b> it was released for viewing.  What am I talking about?  <a href="http://v1.b2ip.com/fooReader/" title="Thief" target="_blank">Take a peek</a>.  Ain't that something?  The company is called B2IP (adding this in here for Google to pick up).<br /><br />Now, when I first saw it, I wanted to give the guy the benefit of the doubt.  I remember downloading code from <a href="http://webfx.eae.net" target="_blank" title="WebFX">WebFX</a> and a few other DHTML sites to learn.  But then I went to the <a href="http://www.b2ip.com/" target="_blank" title="Thief">root domain</a>.  Notice anything (specifically, a complete rip of one of <a href="http://www.forgetfoo.com" target="_blank" title="ForgetFoo">Foo's</a> site... only difference being the middle-of-the-page layout)?<br /><br />If I had released all the code, that would be one thing, but I haven't.  And the fact that they make a profit off the work of others just infuriates me.<br /><br /><b>[Update]</b>B2IP has taken down both FR.NET's UI and the rip of Foo's site (although it still looks <b>alot</b> like a past design).]]></description><dc:date>2005-06-27T14:57:40.077</dc:date></item><item><title>FooReader.NET 1.5</title><link>http://www.wdonline.com/?postid=138</link><description><![CDATA[It's finished for the most part.  I still have some polishing up to do on it, but the functionality is there and everything's working fine and dandy.  Note to self: I need to add in the About page.<br /><br /><a href="http://reader.wdonline.com" title="FooReader.NET">FooReader.NET 1.5</a><br /><br />The biggest change for 1.5 is the way feeds are retrieved.  In version 1, a service was started to update the feeds every hour.  In 1.5, the feed is pulled for every request and then cached in the event the feed couldn't be pulled at a future date.  This method eats more bandwidth, but it is more inline with what Ajax is about: getting up to date information.<br /><br />If you find any problems, please let me know.<br /><br /><b>[Edit]:  </b>The bug for IE is fixed (overflow problems).  Thank goodness for conditional comments!  I also cleaned up the code a bit.]]></description><dc:date>2005-06-26T22:25:55.433</dc:date></item><item><title>21 Days Later</title><link>http://www.wdonline.com/?postid=137</link><description><![CDATA[Aye, it's been a while since my last post.  There's been quite a few things going on that I wanted to blog on, but never got around to it; so I thought I'd just put some thoughts down.<br /><br />NBA Playoffs/Finals:  I'm obviously pleased that the Spurs made it to the finals this year, and like any Spurs fan, I'm obviously miffed that they farted off their 2-0 series lead.  I will be the glued to the tube tonight to watch Game 7.  Games 3, 4, and 6 all seemed like the Spurs actually wanted to lose.  They can suffocate the Pistons (they did it in games 1 and 2), so they better do it tonight!<br /><br />NVIDIA's G70:  Awesome!!  It out-performs a 6800 Ultra SLI setup in many cases, and it costs $400 to $500 less than the SLI setup.  Too bad they probably won't make an AGP version.<br /><br />The Book:  It is just like writing a term paper... except there's the little difference that it'll be read by many more people.  That pressure alone is enough to cause a writer's block.  I rewrote FooReader.NET for it, and I'll upload the new version soon.<br /><br />Battlefield 2:  I have been waiting for this game since it was announced.  I've only played the demo (and very little of it), but I like it.  I recorded some footage and will upload it if I get around to it.  My only complaint is that the weapons feel like Nerf toys (oh yeah... they're inaccurate, too).  I haven't hopped into a chopper yet, but hopefully it'll be like hopping into one in Desert Combat.]]></description><dc:date>2005-06-23T16:43:15.903</dc:date></item><item><title>I Am Not A Spammer!</title><link>http://www.wdonline.com/?postid=136</link><description><![CDATA[I thought I could get away without posting anything on the subject, but apparently I need to.<br /><br />Over the past few years, people have contacted me regarding email that they received from an organization known as WDOnline, LLC.  Of course, the first place someone will check is this web site.  However, I always assumed people would look at the site and see that wdonline.com has nothing to do with prescription medication.  Now, there are some people that are bright enough to gather that, but there are <a href="http://www.wdonline.com/?postid=115" target="_new" title="My First Hate Mail">others that seem to ignore everything they see and head straight to the contact page</a>.  Then there are those that think I do design work for them; that’s not a big leap, either… and no, I don’t do any work for them.<br /><br />I used to average about two emails per year about the subject, but I just received my fifth since the beginning of April… and I am getting a little tired of it.  So I decided that the contact page needs to go through some technical changes.  It stinks that I have to even think about doing it, but it’ll save me time in the long run.  It will add in an extra step for people wanting to use the contact form, but hopefully it will force people to read the disclaimer I will put there.<br /><br />So, for the record:  I am in no way affiliated with WDOnline, LLC, the spamming organization.  I did not spam you.  I am sorry you received spam (aren’t we all?).  Spam and spammers suck, but there isn’t anything we can really do about it.  Welcome to the Internet!]]></description><dc:date>2005-06-02T13:04:09.043</dc:date></item><item><title>Ajax: The Book</title><link>http://www.wdonline.com/?postid=135</link><description><![CDATA[I guess I should say it now.  I am working with <a href="http://www.nczonline.net" title="Nicholas C. Zakas" target="_blind">Nicholas</a> on the new <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/archive/2005/5/190/" title="The Book on Ajax" target="_blank">Ajax book</a>.  I’ve been asked why I haven’t blogged about it yet (I’ve known since Sunday), and honestly I don’t know.  I’m not really one to toot my own horn (except to people I know  haha), but I’m excited as hell!<br /><br />One thing’s for sure: we need ideas.  If you have any ideas on Ajax (components, apps, anything), share them with <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/contact/" title="Contact Nick" target="_blank">Nicholas</a> or <a href="http://www.wdonline.com/?page=Contact" title="Contact Me">myself</a>.  We have some good things lined up, but you can never have too many good things.]]></description><dc:date>2005-05-27T09:05:38.950</dc:date></item><item><title>Star Wars Episode 3</title><link>http://www.wdonline.com/?postid=134</link><description><![CDATA[I find it odd that I haven't blogged anything on the final installment of the Star Wars saga.  What did I think?  It was very good.  It had its moments of "ugh, they could've done that <b>much</b> better", but all in all, it is a very good movie.  Visually, it was stunning.  In the opening sequence when you get to see war going on...  wow!  It's definately worth seeing, so go see it!]]></description><dc:date>2005-05-25T10:58:51.577</dc:date></item><item><title>You Know You&apos;ve...</title><link>http://www.wdonline.com/?postid=133</link><description><![CDATA[Been programming too much lately when you start to design classes in a semi-conscious state based upon your semi-conscious dreams.  That's friggin sad.  Last night, I get into that state where I'm almost asleep and I start to dream.  I can't tell you what the dream was about, but I can tell you that about 2 minutes into the dream I was trying to organize it into a JavaScript class.  Sad, huh?]]></description><dc:date>2005-05-25T10:54:57.420</dc:date></item><item><title>Delete() This</title><link>http://www.wdonline.com/?postid=132</link><description><![CDATA[It was pointed out to me by a fellow named <a href="http://Muthukumar.SK" target="_blank" title="Muthukumar.SK">Muthukumar.SK</a> (link doesn't work for me) that the Delete() method in XWebMenu wasn't working.  After some inspection, I found what I had done.  I failed to update the Delete() method for the Menu object when I changed the HTML structure of the menu.  Oops!<br /><br />The Delete() method isn't documented, but it is apart of the demos.  It is an easy way to get rid of the menu and/or other menu objects.  I have updated the demo code and the released code, so if you ever want to use the Delete() method, it should work now.<br /><br />Thanks again, bud!]]></description><dc:date>2005-05-22T08:58:10</dc:date></item>
