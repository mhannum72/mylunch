VALUES (GETDATE(),'Lo, How a Rose E''er Blooming','Lo, how a Rose e''er blooming from tender stem hath sprung! 
Of Jesse''s lineage coming, as those of old have sung.
It came, a floweret bright, amid the cold of winter,
When half spent was the night.

Isaiah ''twas foretold it, the Rose I have in mind;
With Mary we behold it, the virgin mother kind.
To show God’s love aright, she bore to us a Savior,
When half spent was the night.

The shepherds heard the story proclaimed by angels bright,
How Christ, the Lord of glory was born on earth this night.
To Bethlehem they sped and in the manger they found Him,
As angel heralds said.

This Flower, whose fragrance tender with sweetness fills the air,
Dispels with glorious splendor the darkness everywhere;
True Man, yet very God, from sin and death He saves us,
And lightens every load.

O Savior, Child of Mary, Who felt our human woe,
O Savior, King of glory, Who dost our weakness know;
Bring us at length we pray, to the bright courts of heaven,
And to the endless day!')

Whose kiss seems still the first; whose summoning eyes,
Even now, as for our love-world''s new sunrise,
Shed very dawn; whose voice, attuned above
All modulation of the deep-bowered dove,
Is like a hand laid softly on the soul;
Whose hand is like a sweet voice to control
Those worn tired brows it hath the keeping of

What word can answer to thy word,what gaze
To thine, which now absorbs within its sphere
My worshipping face, till I am mirrored there
Light-circled in a heaven of deep-drawn rays?
What clasp, what kiss mine inmost heart can prove,
O lovely and beloved, O my love?')

Radiant beams from Thy holy face

What sweeter music can we bring,
Than a Carol, for to sing
The Birth of this our heavenly King?
Awake the Voice! Awake the String!
Heart, Ear, and Eye, and every thing
Awake! the while the active Finger
Runs division with the Singer.

From the Flourish they came to the Song.

Voice 1
Dark and dull night, fly hence away,
And give the honor to this Day,
That sees December turn''d to May.

Voice 2
If we may ask the reason, say:
The why, and wherefore all things here
Seem like the Spring-time fo the year?

Voice 3
Why does the chilling Winter''s morn
Smile, like a field beset with corn?
Or smell, like to a mead new-shorn,
Thus, on the sudden?

Voice 4
Come and see
The cause, why things thus fragrant be:
''Tis He is born, whose quick''ning Birth
Gives life and luster, public mirth,
To Heaven and the under-Earth.

Chorus
We see Him come, and know Him ours,
Who, with His Sun-shine, and His Showers,
Turns all the patient ground to flowers.

Voice 1
The Darling of the World is come,
And fit it is, we find a room
To welcome Him.

Voice 2
The nobler part
Of all the house here, is the Heart,

Chorus
Which we will give Him; and bequeath
This Holly and this Ivy Wreath,
To do Him honor; who''s our King,
And Lord of all this Revelling.')
